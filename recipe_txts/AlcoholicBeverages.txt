--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2 1/2          cups  to 3 cups raspberries
                        rinsed
       2          cups  brandy -- approximately
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  water
       1    tablespoon  lemon zest -- grated
     1/2      teaspoon  glycerine; optional
                        thickener

Lightly crush 2 cups of the berries with a fork; place in a quart-size glass canning jar or any other that has an enamel-lined lid. Pour in enough brandy to cover the berries. Add equal portions of the remaining berries and brandy to reach the top of the jar's lip; make sure that all the berries are covered by the brandy. Pour in just enough brandy to begin a small overflow, then tightly cap the jar and wipe the outside clean. Allow to steep in a cool, dark place for 2 months. Or, tape a piece of black construction paper around the jar. Every 2 weeks, gently shake the jar to distribute the flavors. After 2 months, gently pour the jar's contents through a regular strainer or sieve; discard the residue. Follow this by 2 strainings through slightly dampened cheesecloth or through a large clean coffee filter placed inside a funnel; loosely cover the contents with plastic wrap, since the process may take several hours.  In a small pan, combine the sugar, water, and lemon zest. Bring to a boil over moderate-high heat. Simmer, uncovered for 5 minutes. Let cool to room temperature. Add the optional glycerine, if desired. Funnel into a glass bottle, then funnel in the sugar syrup through a strainer, to remove the zest. Cover tightly; shake to blend. Let mature at room temperature, or slightly cooler, for at least 1 month.  Can use vodka instead of brandy.               From "Glorious Liqueurs," Mary Morris.

      10        ounces  raspberries -- or any other
                        berry
   1 1/2          cups  vodka -- or 1 cup vodka and
     1/2             c  brandy
     1/4           cup  sugar syrup *

* Sugar syrup.  1 cup sugar boiled with 1/2 cup water till sugar is thoroughly dissolved. Be sure mixture is cooled before using.

 Add juice and berries to alcohol. Stir and steep one week. Strain. Crush berries through strainer and filter. Taste. Add sugar syrup as necessary. Many frozen fruits are already heavily pre-sugared. If using unsugared fruits without syrup, treat them as fresh fruit but reduce the amount of water when making the sugar syrup because of the water content in the frozen fruit.  Yield. About 2 cups.

                     Caipirinha

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1                spoons of sugar -- (1 to 2)
       1                lime
                        cachaça liquor  (pinga)
                        crushed icecubes

1. Cut the lime into thin slices (8ths and leave some of the peel) and put
at least four slices of it in a glass for whiskey and add the sugar.

2. Add the crushed icecubes to the glass.

3. Now add the pinga (a distilled drink from sugarcane). Make sure the
alcohol just covers the lime pieces and mash this mixture well, using a
little wooden stick or pettle (buy this with your bottle of pinga). If you
really can't find any pinga, try vodka or a good jamaican rum, same effect
only the taste will be different...).When the alcohol is slightly green
and the limes look pretty wrecked, it's ready for (ab)use. 

An alternative (faster) way of making the caipirinha is to put the mixture
of cachaça, limes, sugar and crushed ice in a shaker and pretend if you're
marching in a samba band....
