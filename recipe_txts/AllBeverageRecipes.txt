                     Caipirinha

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time : 0:00
Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1                spoons of sugar -- (1 to 2)
       1                lime
                        cachaça liquor  (pinga)
                        crushed icecubes

1. Cut the lime into thin slices (8ths and leave some of the peel) and put
at least four slices of it in a glass for whiskey and add the sugar.

2. Add the crushed icecubes to the glass.

3. Now add the pinga (a distilled drink from sugarcane). Make sure the
alcohol just covers the lime pieces and mash this mixture well, using a
little wooden stick or pettle (buy this with your bottle of pinga). If you
really can't find any pinga, try vodka or a good jamaican rum, same effect
only the taste will be different...).When the alcohol is slightly green
and the limes look pretty wrecked, it's ready for (ab)use. 

An alternative (faster) way of making the caipirinha is to put the mixture
of cachaça, limes, sugar and crushed ice in a shaker and pretend if you're
marching in a samba band....
